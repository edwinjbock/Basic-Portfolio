        Pastor, and Director of Business and Finance. In other words, he has been all over the map and garnered a lot of
        valuable skills along the way.</p>

      <p>Because of his varied experience Ed feels comfortable in the realms of technology, finance, business, interpersonal
        communication and public speaking in front of large audiences. All skills which he will have to offer his sought-after
        Web Dev employer.</p>

      <p>In college he studied Industrial/Systems Engineering and Computer Science, ultimately receiving a BBA in Finance
