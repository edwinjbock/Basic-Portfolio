        currently a Firefighter/Paramedic in Central Florida he has decided to return to his IT roots as a Fullstack Web Development
        Application Developer. He is currently enrolled in the University of Central Florida's Web Development Bootcamp with an
        expected graduation of February, 2019.</p>

      <p>In addition to being a FF/PM, his diverse career roles include HRIS Systems Analyst, Bank Manager, Account Manager, Pastor,
        and Director of Business and Finance. In other words, he was all over the map for a time.</p>
      
      <p>Because of his varied experience Ed feels comfortable in the realms of technology, finance, business, interpersonal communication  and public speaking in front of large audiences.</p>
      
      <p>In college he studied Industrial/Systems Engineering and Computer Science, ultimately receiving a BBA in Finance from
